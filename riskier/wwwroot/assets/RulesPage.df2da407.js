Infantry have 1 movement point, 1 offensive point, and a range of 1. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>--Special Forces</span> are similar to infantry in that they are defensively balanced, but are a fair bit more effective offensively. They also have the ability to occupy fortifications. Special forces have access to certain operational events that no other unit has. Special forces have the ability to carry laser designators giving artillery more accuracy and gaining access to destroyer artillery if applicable. SF units have 1 movement point, 1 offensive point, and a range of 1. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>--Mechanized Infantry (Mechanized)</span> are a heavier more mobile version of infantry.

Guided shots are much more effective. Artillery have 1 movement point, 1 offensive point, and a range of 3 on the combat board. On the main board artillery can fire into adjacent tiles so long as there are no fortifications present on that tile. Artillery cannot fire into tiles with fortifications. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>--Missile-Artillery</span> is a very effective form of artillery but is limited on the enemies ability to shoot down missiles.

Fighter aircraft have 4 movement points, 1 offensive point, and a range of 2 on the combat board. They can move 3 tiles on the main board per turn. Fighter aircraft must stay within 3 tiles of an airfield. Once a fighter aircraft has used its 1 offensive point (on the main board) the player will immediately return it to an airfield within range. Fighters on the combat board can remain for the duration of the battle but once they are taken off the combat board or the battle ends they will be immediately moved to a airfield within range. Fighters can only attack once and then have to return to an airfield before they can attack again on the main board. Fighters also have the ability to attack on the main board wherever they want so long as they are within 3 tiles of an owned airfield. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>--Close Air Support (CAS)</span> aircraft are very effective at destroying ground targets and provide some air cover against other CAS aircraft. However, they cannot target fighter aircraft and only have a small chance to evade fighter attacks. CAS have 3 movement points, 2 offensive points, and a range of 1 on the combat board. CAS cannot attack on the main board. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>--Supply Aircraft</span> can deliver supplies by air to ground units and transport units from airfield to airfield.

Each unit has peg holes in them to track damage. The carrier has up to 8 fighters/CAS and has a point defense system that can intercept missiles and aircraft. Cruisers carry AA and SS missiles with long range capabilities. Destroyers are fast durable ships with heavy guns to destroy other ships as well as barrage land targets. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Each ship has a specific construction time. Carriers take 3 turns to construct. Cruisers and destroyers take 2 turns to construct. The construction times are tracked on the construction sheet. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>--Carriers</span> have the ability to carry up to 8 fighter aircraft and CAS. They are durable ships and rely on their aircraft for offensive and defensive capabilities. Carriers have point defense systems that let them target incoming missiles and aircraft. Carriers also have the ability to transport and land up to 6 ground units. The carrier game piece has 8 holes on the front of the ship and 3 in the middle. When the carrier is hit a red peg is placed into one of the 3 holes in the center of the ship to track damage. The 8 holes on the front represent the carriers cargo and aircraft. Blue pegs represent a single fighter and white represent CAS. Carriers have 1 movement point, 4 hit points, and no offensive points, however they can deploy 2 aircraft per turn. Carriers point defense has a range of 1 on the mainboard and the combat board. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--If a carrier is destroyed all the aircraft on the ship are destroyed as well unless they are within range of another carrier that has available space or an airfield. However, the aircraft that are in the air can continue to fight until the battle is over then they are immediately moved to another airfield within range or are destroyed. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>--Cruisers</span> are much more versatile than destroyers, but are not as durable or nimble. They have the ability to deploy surface-to-surface missiles and AA missiles. They have a small cannon that is mostly effective at htting other cruisers. Cruisers have 2 movement points, 1 hit point, and 1 offensive point. On the combat board cruisers AA has a range of 2 and their SS missiles have a range of 4. The cannon has a range of 1. A cruisers cannon cannot fire at land targets. Cruiser can provide Missile artillery support on the main board if a laser designator is being used and the cruiser is within 2 tiles on the main board of where the combat is taking place. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>--Destroyers</span> are heavy combat vessels with large guns and heavy armor giving them the ability to absorb hits. They are smaller and more nimble than most naval vessals and are great at destroying other naval vessels. They have no AA ability. Destroyers have 1 peg hole to keep track of damage. Destroyers have 2 movement points, 2 hit points, and 2 offensive points with a range of 1. Destroyers have the ability to provide fire support to land battles so long as they are adjacent to the tile where the battle is taking place. They can only fire when there is a special forces unit with a laser designator directing its fire. </p><div class="text-center text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7><h3 data-v-9ef899d7>Combat Rules</h3></div><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7> --Rules about initiating combat:</span> Only 1 offensive move per tile is allowed per turn. This means that a player can only attack from a tile once per turn. Atleast 3 units need to be used to iniate combat. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Land battles take place on a seperate board called the combat board. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Before combat begins be sure to place any item cards face up in front of the player at the combat board when being used. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--The defending player places their units first on the board and then the offensive player places theirs. There is a maximum of 12 ground units each for both sides on the board at one time. There is no limit on aircraft. A maximum of 2 ground units can share the same tile, however there is no limit on aircraft. If there are more than 12 defending units involved the defending player can decide to retreat the extra units or keep them as reserves to be used in combat later. Offense can only deploy a max of 12 units at one time as well, but does not get to use reserves. The defending player will place their 3 bunkers (only infantry or Special forces can use bunkers) and all their units involved and place them in the middle of the combat board. The defending player cannot place units on first row of tiles closest to them. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Infantry/Special forces that occupy fortifications take 2 hits to destroy. If a player only lands 1 successful hit then the fortification is destroyed and removed from play but the infantry remains. Tiles with fortifications can only have 1 unit at a time on that tile. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>-- The defending player must deploy all their units possible up to the maximum of 12. For example the defending player cannot deploy 2 units and have the other 10 retreat. If they wish to try and retreat they need to follow the retreat rules. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--The offensive player will place their units as close to the defending player as they wish. However, they cannot place their units behind the defending player unless they are using the paratroopers item. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--During combat if the defending player loses units they can deploy reserves and they will enter the combat board in the row closest to the defending player. When reserve are placed they cannot move until the next turn. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--During combat every unit is subject to their environmental rules to determine their probabilities of hitting and missing attacks. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Fighters and CAS can be deployed immediately or they can be set to the side and called up when players wish to use them. When aircraft are deployed they will be placed on the 1st row closest to the player deploying the aircraft. Fighter aircraft can move and attack immediately. CAS can move immediately but they cannot attack until the players next turn. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Any action an aircraft takes when they are within AA range the AA gets to fire 1 shot at the aircraft. This applies to all AA that is in range. For example if a player moves their aircraft into AA range the AA get to fire at them first before the aircraft can do anything else. During that same turn if that aircraft moves onto another tile and is still within AA range the AA gets to fire again. This can occur as many times as the aircraft moves within AA range. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Once a unit is locked into combat that unit cannot move until they destroy the enemy or are relieved by another unit. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>--Example of combat:</span> An IFV unit attacks an enemy unit on the space next to it. The attacking unit fails to destroy the defending unit. The attacking player still has 3 movement points left but cannot attack with that unit again during this turn. If the attacking unit was successfull they would move into the space they captured and this would count as 1 movement point. The player can still move the unit 2 more space but cannot attack anymore. If the attacking unit were an MBT it can attack twice in one turn as well as move twice. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7> Example of combat:</span> A mechanized unit is attacking an infantry unit. They both roll successfull hits and neither of them are destroyed, however the mech unit cannot attack again since it only has 1 attack point. And since the mech unit was unsuccessfull at destroying the infantry the mech is now locked in combat with the infantry and cannot move even though it still has 2 movement points left. If during that same turn another unit comes along and destroys the infantry they are no longer locked in combat and can now move if they wish. If the mech unit was not relieved at the end of the players turn the other player can now go on the offensive against the mech unit. </p><div class="text-center text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7><h3 data-v-9ef899d7>Retreat Rules</h3></div><p data-v-9ef899d7>--The defending/offensive players can retreat by moving there units to first row of tiles closest to them on the combat board and declaring that the unit is retreating. They have to remain on that tile for 1 turn in order to retreat and be will removed from the board. If the combat board is not being used the retreating player declares that they are retreating and the retreating unit will have to survive 1 turn before moving the unit in the opposite direction where combat is taking place. Once it is declared that a unit is retreating this cannot be undone and the unit will be removed after 1 turn unless it is destroyed. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Once a unit has retreated the player will move that unit one space in the opposite direction to any friendly or non-hostile territory. If the opposite tile is water or hostile territory the unit will move to the nearest safe tile. If there are no safe tiles the unit cannot retreat. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Fighter Aircraft can retreat instantly and will be returned to any airfield within range. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Combat is resolved once all of a players units are destroyed or the attacker/defender retreats from the battlefield. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--If both players declare that they want to end combat before all units have been destroyed/retreated then combat immediately ends. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Players involved should keep track of units lost and territory lost during combat and then update their economies immediately after the combat phase ends. This means adding and subtracting your resources to reflect your casualties and territory lost. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--When a player takes territory from another player they must hold that territory for 1 turn before they can claim it. Once claimed they can then roll for resources and draw a card from the item deck. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>--Retreating when a unit has no supplies: </span> In the event a army/division has no supplies left to defend themselves from an attack they must all retreat. A dice roll for each unit retreating will be used determine a successfull escape or not. Using a D12 the defending player must roll 2 higher than the attacking player to escape. If a unit successfully escapes the player can choose which adjacent tile to place each unit. If there are no safe tiles to retreat to then all units are destroyed. </p><div class="text-center text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7><h3 data-v-9ef899d7>Navy Combat Rules</h3></div><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Naval units do not need to occupy the same MB tile to all be included in a naval battle. All adjacent naval units to the tile where combat is initiated will be included on the combat board. A max of 3 ships can occupy a tile at one time. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Their is a combat board for naval battles as well and is largely identical to the combat board for land battles. The difference however is that the defending player can only place their units on the 2nd and 3rd row closest to them. The attacking player can place their units on the first 3 rows closest to them. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Any action an aircraft takes when they are within AA range the AA gets to fire 1 shot at the aircraft. This applies to all AA that is in range. For example if a player moves their aircraft into AA range the AA get to fire at them first before the aircraft can do anything else (unless the aircraft is using the stealth item). During that same turn if that aircraft moves onto another tile and is still within AA range the AA gets to fire again. This can occur as many times as the aircraft moves within AA range. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Destroyers have heavy armor giving them a chance to absorb any incoming hits. </p><div class="text-center text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7><h3 data-v-9ef899d7>Item Card Rules</h3></div><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Players start with 3 item cards chosen at random from the deck. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Items are cards that are drawn from a pile every time a player takes a territory including territory not owned by another player. This does not apply to territory claimed during set-up phase. Players can have as many item cards as they want. Once they are used shuffle them back into item deck. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Item cards are placed face up in front of the player when using an item card at the combat board. The item cards will not be placed face up until both players have chosen the items they will be using. Once players choose and place their cards face up they cannot remove or change them. Players should not know what items another player is going to use before they place them face up. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>--Exsplosive Reactive Armor:</span> This can be used before a battle begins to increase MBT&#39;s odds of surving a hit. When an MBT takes a hit roll a D12 to determine if the reactive armor deflects the shot 1-5 is successful. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>--Laser Designator:</span> This item can be used beofre a battle to increase the odds of artillery hitting its target. Special forces units are required to use the laser designator item. Enemy units next to a special forces unit can be lased and give artillery a better chance of hitting their target so long as the artillery is within range. Lasing a target does not use up the special forces offensive point. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>--Cruise Missile:</span> This item can be used during a players 3rd phase before or after a battle. It cannot be used during a battle. Cruise missiles can be launched from any of the players cruisers to hit targets as far away as 4 tiles on the MB. Cruise missile hits are determined by a D12 (1-10), and they can only be intercepted using the Point Defense item, carrier, or AA. If the cruise missile flies over a hostile tile with AA (not including cities) or a carrier the player that owns that tile should roll a D12 to try and intercept the missile. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>Point Defense:</span> The point defense item can be used by a defending player before a battle to provide better AA and anti-missile protection. If used on an aircraft D12 1-9 is a hit. Point defense can only target 1 unit and is discarded after use regardless of outcome. Defending players can use as many point defense cards as they want but will need to declare how many cards they are going to deploy before the battle. Item cannot be used during naval battles. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>Aircraft Stealth:</span> The stealth card can be applied before a battle. This will reverse attack order of AA and aircraft meaning the aircraft will fire first and then the AA will fire second and also reduces the AA hit chance to D12 (1-6). If the AA is destroyed by an aircrafts first shot the AA does not get to fire. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>Surplus Fuel:</span> This item can be used before a battle begins to upgrade mechanized units movement. When used mechanized units can now move 3 spaces on the battlefield but can still only attack once per turn. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>Paratroopers:</span> This item card can be used before combat by the offensive player. The offensive player can place up to 3 infantry units behind the defending player during the combat board set-up phase. This requires the offensive player to have infantry or SF infantry present when the attack is initiated. If AA is present then each infantry unit being deployed as paratroopers will have to survive one AA attack roll. The AA only gets to shoot once at each paratrooper. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7><span class="text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7>Javelin Missiles</span> : This item card equips infantry units (not SF) with effective anti-tank weapons.

The 4th player draws the card and proceeds to resolve whatever event the card presents. Players cannot decline any event unless the card says otherwise. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--The player(s) affected by the event card is determined by a D4 dice roll or based on whatever is written on the card (it may affect all players). The 4th player rolls the D4 and each number represents a player based on their team color. Player 1 is green, player 2 is tan, player 3 is brown, and player 4 is blue. </p><div class="text-center text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7><h3 data-v-9ef899d7>Structure Rules</h3></div><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Only one structure can occupy any one tile, except for factories on capitals. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Players capitals act as airfields.

One Fortification placed on the game board represents 3 Fortifications on the combat board. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Only Infantry and special forces can use fortifications and it gives provides immunity to artillery. It also gives the occupying unit an extra hitpoint. A successfull hits on a fortification destroys it, but not the unit occupying it. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Naval Yards can be built on any tile that is next to a water tile. Each naval yard can build up to three ships at a time. This is tracked on the unit construction sheet. The player must own the tile the naval yard is built from. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Naval yards can repair a max of 2 cruisers/destroyers or 1 carrier at one time. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Factories can be built on any city except small cities and are used to increase production capacity. When they are built onto cities they increase your faction production by 1. Capitals can have 2 factories. Large and medium cities can have 1 factory. And small cities cannot have factories. Factories can be destroyed in one successfull hit. </p><div class="text-center text-warning" data-v-9ef899d7><h3 data-v-9ef899d7>Army/Division Rules</h3></div><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Army and Division pieces are a way to consolidate large groups of units. Armies are groups of 9 units and Divisions are groups of 6. Each unit piece has holes that represent each unit within the division or army. Division pieces have 10 peg holes and army pieces have 13 peg holes. The group of 4 peg holes represent the supplies the army/division has total if their supply line is cut. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Units contained within these groups will be tracked on paper or the companion app. If a unit is destroyed it will be erased from the resource sheet or removed on the app. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Units that are not within a division or army can join these groups to replace destroyed units. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--If more than half of a division or army group is destroyed, and the player does not have any extra units within range to immediately replace the lost units then the division or army is disbanded and replaced with the remaining individual units. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Divisions and army groups can only move if all units within the group have not already moved. For example if a unit traveled 1 space to join the group the entire group cannot move until next turn. </p><p data-v-9ef899d7>--Divisions and Army groups can instantly capture unnoccupied tiles. </p></div>',2),c={class:"col-12 d-flex justify-content-center my-3"};function f(p,t,u,a,v,y){return s(),i("body",d,[e("div",h,[l,e("div",c,[e("button",{onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=m=>a.backToTop()),class:"btn"},"Back-to-Top")])])])}const b=n(o,[["render",f],["__scopeId","data-v-9ef899d7"]]);export{b as default};
