# riskier

Quick Summary:
Riskier is my first iteration of a board game companion app designed to be used on mobile devices. Utilizing a VueJS front-end and Bootstrap. With a C# dotNet REST API with mySQL database. Allows users to track all their assets, groups, and resources to make their gameplay smoother and more fun. If you would like to check out the app I currently am hosting it here: https://riskier.onrender.com/ NOTE: This version is a minimum viable product I created for testing and learning purposes.

"Riskier" is the code name for a board I have been developing over the past year. I have been using tinkercad to design my own pieces and then use my 3d printer to build them. Riskier is a military conquest game where the objective is simply to capture the entire board. However, the number of variables a player needs to track can become overwhelming. This app alleviates that along with improving quality of life.  I built this app for players to use while playing the board game. 

How it works:
Once a user creates an account they can begin using the app. There are currently three pages to the app: the home page, game page, and rules page. The home page is used to give the player some quick tips on setting the game up. The game page is where all the logic of the game takes place. Players can track their factions resources, military units and assets on the game page. Players can also create groups of military units called armies or divisions which have their own pieces on the game board. This is designed to reduce clutter on the game board by consolidating 6-9 pieces into 1 piece. A player can also capture regions that can be tracked on the app. When a region is claimed the app randomly generates resources for that region. Regions are what give the player their resources they can spend on units and assets. Lastly, there is the rules page that contains all the rules for the game that a player can reference. 

The future:
This app I primarily designed to be my minimum viable product while I developed and tested the game further. Currently I am developing a new more complete version of my riskier app utilizing google firebase to act as my database and auth provider.
